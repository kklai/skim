Skim for Mobile
====

Skim was created at #SNDMakes March 21-23, 2014.

The project is an exploration of long-form stories on smartphones. As screens get smaller it becomes increasingly difficult for readers to browse a story in order to gauge their interest before making a commitment to engage fully.
